I have worked as a back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer, as well as a systems analyst, and have also worked as a freelancer. During this period, I have gathered requirements, implemented new features, refactored code, fixed bugs, and created entire ecosystems (web, APIs, and mobile). Therefore, I can work as a junior and feel confident enough to work as a full-stack developer."

The only limit is your imagination."

I started with free courses on YouTube and other platforms, but I have also invested in paid courses to become more professional and, above all, to specialize in the technologies I already know. I believe that complacency is what disqualifies a professional from the job market over time."
